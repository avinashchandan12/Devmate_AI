## Overview

**DevMate AI** is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension designed to help developers enhance their code by analyzing time and space complexity for each function and offering AI-driven optimization suggestions. This tool currently supports JavaScript (`.js`), TypeScript (`.ts`), and JSX (`.jsx`) file formats.

Whether you're concerned about code performance or want to improve algorithmic efficiency, DevMate AI helps identify areas for improvement in real time—directly within your coding environment.

## Features

- **Time & Space Complexity Analysis**: Instantly displays time and space complexity for each function.
- **AI-Driven Code Optimization**: Get smart, AI-powered suggestions for optimizing your code.
- **File Type Support**: Works with JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX files.
- **Seamless Integration**: Results and optimizations are displayed directly within the VS Code editor for a smooth workflow.

## How It Works

### 1. **Install the Extension**
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Navigate to the Extensions Marketplace and search for `DevMate AI`.
   - Click **Install** to add it to your workspace.

### 2. **Usage**
   - Open a supported file (`.js`, `.ts`, or `.jsx`).
   - For each function, you'll see two options:
     - **Analyze Complexity**: Get a quick analysis of time and space complexity.
     - **Optimize with AI**: Receive actionable, AI-driven optimization suggestions to improve function performance.

### 3. **Analyze Complexity**
   - Click **Analyze Complexity** to calculate and display the time and space complexity of the function.
   - Results will be shown in the "API Response" section on the left side of the editor.

### 4. **Optimize with AI**
   - Click **Optimize with AI** to get AI-generated suggestions for improving the function's performance.
   - The optimized code will be displayed in the same "API Response" section.
